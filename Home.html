<b>The St. Louis Cardinals are an American professional baseball team based in St. Louis, Missouri.
 The Cardinals compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) Central division.
 Busch Stadium has been their home ballpark since 2006.
 With origins as one of the early professional baseball clubs in St. Louis, 
 entrepreneur Chris von der Ahe purchased a barnstorming club in 1881, 
 then known as the Brown Stockings, and established them as charter members of the American Association 
 (AA) which played 1882 to 1891, the following season. Upon the discontinuation of the AA, St. Louis joined the NL in 1892;
 at that time,
 they were called the Browns and the Perfectos before they were 
 officially renamed as the Cardinals in 1900.
