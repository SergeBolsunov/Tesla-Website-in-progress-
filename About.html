One of the most successful franchises in baseball history, 
the Cardinals have won 11 World Series championships,
 the second-most in Major League Baseball (behind the New York Yankees)
 and the most in the National League.
 Their 19 National League pennants rank third in NL history.
 In addition, St. Louis has won 13 division titles in the East
 and Central divisions. While still in the AA, St. Louis won four 
 league championships, qualifying them to play in a forerunner of 
 the World Series. They tied in 1885 and won outright in 1886,[4] both
 times against Chicago, in the first meetings of the Cardinals–Cubs
 rivalry that continues to this day.
Cardinals achievements that have impacted MLB and sports in general
 include Branch Rickey's pioneering of the farm system,
 Rogers Hornsby's two batting Triple Crowns, Dizzy Dean's 30-win season 
 in 1934, Stan Musial's 17 MLB and 29 NL records, 
 Bob Gibson's 1.12 earned run average (ERA) in 1968,
 Whitey Herzog's Whiteyball, Mark McGwire breaking the single-season
 home run record in 1998, and the 2011 championship team's
 unprecedented comebacks.[5] The Cardinals have won 105 or more games
 in four different seasons and won 100 or more a total of nine times.
 Cardinals players have won 20 league MVPs, four batting Triple Crowns,
 and three Cy Young Awards. Baseball Hall of Fame inductees include 
 Lou Brock, Dizzy Dean, Bob Gibson, Whitey Herzog, Rogers Hornsby,
 Joe Medwick, Stan Musial, Branch Rickey, Red Schoendienst, Ozzie Smith,
 and Bruce Sutter.
In 2018, Forbes valued the Cardinals at $1.9 billion,
 making them the 7th-most valuable franchise in MLB;
 their revenue the previous year was $319 million, 
 and their operating income was $40.0 million.[6][7][8] 
 Since their purchase in 1995, 
 owner William DeWitt, Jr.'s investment group has seen enormous growth
 from the $147 million purchase price. John Mozeliak is the 
 President of Baseball Operations, Mike Girsch is the general manager 
 and Mike Shildt is the interim manager.[9][10] The Cardinals are
 renowned for their strong fan support: despite being in one of 
 the sport's mid-level markets, they routinely see attendances among 
 the league's highest, and are consistently among the Top 3 in MLB in 
 local television ratings.
